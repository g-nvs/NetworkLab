# Home Network Lab

## Objective

The Home Network Lab aimed to build the "fundations" for the next projects I had in mind and also helped gain in-depth understanding of network operations and security.
The primary objective was to build a secured-by-design network with segmentation and isolation with a mix of virtualization and physical hardware.
